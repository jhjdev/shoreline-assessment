# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [The Bartender Order  Service Dashboard](https://github.com/jhjdev/bartender-order-service).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

installs all dependencies.

After that, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## To-Do list:

- Create a better tooltip for the Rechart line chart, so that the date is correctly displayed on hover. At the moment, it's there but not visible.
- Setup Jest tests, that should be accessable with the command:
  ##### `yarn test`
- Setup better linting, that should be accessable with the command:
  ##### `yarn lint`
